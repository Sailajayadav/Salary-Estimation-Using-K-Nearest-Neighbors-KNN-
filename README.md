Introduction

Salary estimation is an important problem in various industries, helping employers and job seekers make informed decisions. This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict whether a person earns a good salary based on input features. The model analyzes patterns in the dataset to provide accurate predictions.

Features

- Predicts whether a person earns a good salary based on:
  - Age
  - Education level
  - Capital
  - Hours per week
  - Income
- Binary classification output: Good salary or not.
- Uses the KNN algorithm for simplicity and interpretability.
- Easily extensible with additional features or datasets.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains fields such as:

- Age
- Education level
- Capital
- Hours per week
- Income

The target variable is whether the person earns a good salary (binary classification).

You can use a publicly available dataset like the [UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) or create your own.


Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt))

Key Python libraries used:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`


 Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-estimation-knn.git
    cd salary-estimation-knn
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

 Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

   - Place your dataset file (e.g., `data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset format matches the expected input.

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python salary_estimation.py
    ```

3. Modify parameters (e.g., number of neighbors `k`) in the `config.json` file.

4. Visualize results:

   - Prediction outputs will be displayed in the terminal.
   - Graphs and metrics will be saved in the `output/` directory.
